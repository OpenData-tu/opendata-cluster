# Getting Started

# Installing tools
You need to install `kops` and kubectl `cli` tools first. Mainly you will need to follow this [documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md).
Probably you will need to install [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
